## About the Video Course
Web application code can get tangled up, which makes it hard to test and maintain. Also, asynchronous computations are HTTP to manage. However, with RxJS you can unify, filter, and transform these streams with ease. By introducing RxJS into your code, you can build clean and fault-tolerant web applications.
This course shows you to handle work tasks and issues with RxJS. It helps you develop the skills you need to create Reactive applications with RxJS. With this course, you'll enter the Reactive world by using Angular and React. You will learn to execute asynchronous event handling techniques using RxJS.
By the end of the course, you'll be saving precious development time by using RxJS. You'll scale your own applications effectively, and use frameworks that rely on RxJS.
